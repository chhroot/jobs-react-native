# Job Search Native

This is a React Native project created with Expo CLI and integrated with Rapid API to provide job listings, job details, and nearby job search functionality. The app allows users to explore popular jobs and filter them based on job type (full-time, part-time, or contract) to find their desired opportunities conveniently. The React Native Job Finder App is designed to simplify the job search process for users by presenting them with relevant job listings, detailed job descriptions, and the ability to find nearby job opportunities. The integration with Rapid API ensures access to up-to-date and accurate job data, enhancing the overall user experience.
